## Fraction Calculator

### ðŸ¥‡ My First Programming Project

The **Fraction Calculator** marks the first project I've ever undertaken in programming. Having started my programming journey with Pythonâ€”known for its simplicity and versatilityâ€”I chose to develop this project using Python's Kivy framework, which provided a straightforward way to visualize expressions.

This idea sprouted towards the end of my 12th year, driven by a desire to enhance my mathematical skills in school. By the age of 13, the project reached completion and proved to be an invaluable tool for handling fractions, standing out as the most convenient fraction calculator for my needs.

I have decided to preserve this project in its original form, without any further modifications, to keep it as a cherished historical memento. ðŸ˜Š

### Features

- **Simplify Fractions:** Reduce fractions to their simplest form.
- **Extract Whole Part:** Separate the whole part from an improper fraction.
- **Decimal Conversion:** Convert fractions to decimal format.
- **Common Denominator:** Convert a set of fractions to have a common denominator for easy comparison or addition/subtraction.
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on fractions.

### User Interface

- The calculator features a large display area for the current expression or result.
- There are two main sets of buttons:

  ```1``` **Function Buttons:** These include actions like simplifying fractions, extracting whole parts, converting to decimals, and finding common denominators.

  ```2``` **Numeric and Operation Buttons:** Standard calculator buttons (0-9, +, -, *, /) along with special fraction-related operations like whole number extraction.

- Users interact with the calculator by pressing buttons to input fractions and operations, then pressing the '=' button to compute the result.


### Technical Details

- The application utilizes the `fractions.Fraction` class from Python's standard library for handling fractional arithmetic, ensuring precise calculations without floating-point errors.
- The Kivy library is used for creating the graphical user interface, making it responsive and visually appealing.
